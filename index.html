              Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life.
              Good books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right
              direction. There is no better companion than a good book. Reading
              is important because it is good for your overall well-being. Once
              you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you
              start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to
              it. Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books
              is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read
              a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the
              brain muscles for healthy functioning.

              Poetry is a form of literary art that uses aesthetic and often
              rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to,
              or in place of, literal or surface-level meanings. Any particular
              instance of poetry is called a poem and is written by a poet.
              Poets use a variety of techniques called poetic devices, such as
              assonance, alliteration, euphony and cacophony, onomatopoeia,
              rhythm, and sound symbolism, to produce musical or incantatory
              effects. Most poems are formatted in verse: a series or stack of
              lines on a page, which follow a rhythmic or other deliberate
              pattern. For this reason, verse has also become a synonymfor
              poetry

              Weather is the day-to-day state of atmosphere and pertains to
              short term changes in conditions of heat, moisture and air
              movement. Weather results from processes that attempt to equalise
              the differences in the distribution of net radiant energy from
              sun. In other words, the instantaneous state of atmosphere can be
              called as weather. It is usually expressed as fine, fair, foggy,
              cloudy, rainy, sunny or windy weather.
